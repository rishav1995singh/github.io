       <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public
            schools (controlled and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and 
            private schools. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education 
            is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public 
            schools to private schools in India is 7:5.
            Most schools in India do not offer subject and scheduling flexibility due to budgeting constraints (for e.g.: most students in India are not allowed to take Chemistry and History in grades 11-12 because they are part of different "streams"). Private candidates (i.e. not studying in a school) are generally not allowed to register for and take board examinations but there are some exceptions such as NIOS.</p>

       <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Secondary education covers children aged 14 to 18, a group comprising 88.5 million children according to the 2001 Census of India. The final two years of secondary is often called Higher Secondary (HS), Senior Secondary, or simply the "+2" stage. The two-halves of secondary education are each an important stage for which a pass certificate is needed, and thus are affiliated by central boards of education under HRD ministry, before one can pursue higher education, including college or professional courses.</p>
